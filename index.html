        <h1> Hi! Let's learn about me! <meta charset="UTF-8" p>&#129528 &#127775 &#128120;&#127997</p></h1>
        <hr> My name is MacKenzie Jackson and I am a sophmore at Gonzaga University. 
            I study business marketing and double minor in public relations and digital marketing. 
            In my future I want to work in sports marketing, specifically Formula 1.
            I chose marketing as my area of study because I am a creative person and believe this will be an effective way to utilize my creativity.
            <br><br>
            I am from the San Francisco Bay Area, and live in a small town called San Carlos. 
            I have an older sister, Alexis, who's a nurisng student, we always get told we look alike, but I've never been able to see it. 
            And my sister has a son named is Maverick! He's turning 2 this November!
            Growing up, we were never a family for cats or dogs, but we had hamsters and fish, so over the course of my childhood, I had 3 hamsters and likely around 6 fish!
            We grew up playing a lot of sports but I stuck with softball the longest. I played from ages 5-18, making that 13 years!
            I met some amazing friends from my time playing, and I was lucky enough to play with 1 of them for almost the entirety of my softball career!

            I met some great people here at Gonzaga as well!
            I currently live in a suite-style dorm with my 3 best friends, and we will continue living together throughout junior and senior year! 
            We already have a house for the next 2 school years and talk about it everyday because we are so excited!
            We have so many plans for what we want to do when we are able to move in, it's going to look so good once we have it all decorated!
            This university was the perfect choice for me and I am so grateful to attend here. I've met such amazing people who make it better than I could have imagined.
            Though Gonzaga was not my first choice for college, I now realize after being here for some time what a perfect fit it is for me!

            Music is something that I really enjoy, I use it as a way to relax or energize myself, both listening to and playing.
            Some of my favorite artist are Harry Styles, Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, Lana Del Rey, and many more.
            Recently, Olivia Rodrigo has been my most streamed artist, I even went to her concert this past August!
            Concerts are another thing that bring my lots of joy and I feel very lucky to have seen some pretty amazing artist perform live.
